Hi, here is Complete React Roadmap..

We have created a new Repo in for this roadmap..
then into vs code..
first we open a terminal and then to create our react app we type our fiest command..
=>npx create-react-app "filename"

<!-- ***************************************** -->

* install following packages..
=> npm i react-router-dom
=> npm i react-hot-toast
=> npm i axios

* "npm start" command to start our app..

<!-- ***************************************** -->

* useNavigate is Hook which we use to route from one page to another without refreshing our website..

<!-- ***************************************** -->

* useEffect Hook is used to do particular code at a particular time.. there are 4types of useEffect:
No Dependency; Empty Dependency; Single Dependency; Multiple Depenedency..

for example:
* type 1 No Dependency => 

useEffect(()=>{
    alert('hi no dependency')
})

In this effect page will alert on every changes which will happen in website..
for ex: alert on every counter

<!-- ***************************************** -->
* type 2 Empty Dependency=>
 
useEffect(()=>{
    alert('hi from empty dependency')
}, [])

In this effect page will alert on first page hitting and after every hard refresh..
for ex: alert on only first page hitting time or hard refresh

<!-- ***************************************** -->
* type 3 Single Dependency =>

useEffect(()=>{
    alert('this alert occured due to single dependency counter')
}, [counter])

for ex:
alert on first refresh and every counter change.. and hard refresh..

<!-- ***************************************** -->
* type 4 Multi Dependency =>

useEffect(()=>{
    alert('this alert occured due to single dependency counter')
}, [counter1, counter2])

for ex:
alert on first refresh and every counter change.. and hard refresh..

<!--*****************************************-->

params are basically used while creating products page single product page like functinality
where when you you have 4 products or n no of products and when you click on any one product that particular prodcuts should open in new tab..

* main component code:
route '/mainproduct

in main route w will route single pro link 
'/single-pro/1234' here id is replaced by static value 1234 

* single component code:
route'/single-pro/:id

* in component - 
when you replace ':id' in main product page we can call it using useParams() 
const { id } = useParams();


<!-- ***************************** -->
functional based component apna normal apan joh use krte hai..

second is class based components..

why all r ignoring class based component becoz in class based we cannot use hook method..
<!-- ***************************** -->


all products component..

we fetch our all prodcuts data from a randoem fake site for example ..
so we willl first run async function get products 
inside this fucntion we will store the data with the help of get method 

and this fucntion will run on every render cause we will use empty useeffect method..
so that incase in future some new data are  added it will also get displayed because we are using method on every refresh 

once we get data we will store in set usestate method and then we will map product..

* While products mapping=>

We will use Params method in all products cmponent we will just pass route to our child div were we are mapping single products 

below onclick code is very important it will help to go to each individual product..

* onClick={()=>route(`/single-product/${product.id}`)} *

<div key={i} className='allproducts-child' onClick={()=>route(`/single-product/${product.id}`)}>
    <h2>{product.title}</h2>
    <p>{product.description}</p>
    <a>{product.price}</a>
</div>
